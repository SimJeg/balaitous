This code was used to train the Balaitous model for the final phase of the [STOIC2021 - COVID-19 AI Challenge](https://stoic2021.grand-challenge.org/) (user: simon.j).

Three large artifacts were originally pushed in `training/artifact` using git-lfs but have been removed to avoid paying GitHub  monthly fees. You can download `vitl_16_ct.pth` and `vitl_16_pt22k.pth` [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6547999#.Yn9QjJNBxSA) and `unet_r231-d5d2fc3d.pth` [here](https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask/releases/download/v0.0/unet_r231-d5d2fc3d.pth).
